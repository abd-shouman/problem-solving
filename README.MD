For each file, the tile of the problem along with a description is provided

## symmetic_difference.js
### Algorithms: Find the Symmetric Difference
Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays.
Given two sets (for example set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}), the mathematical term "symmetric difference" of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both (A △ B = C = {1, 4}). For every additional symmetric difference you take (say on a set D = {2, 3}), you should get the set with elements which are in either of the two the sets but not both (C △ D = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}). The resulting array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).

## inventory_update.js
### Algorithms: Inventory Update
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.
